Average Daily Loss



6️⃣ Report Development

Built a multi-page Power BI report focused on:

Demand vs Availability analysis

Financial impact (profit, loss, daily loss)


Designed KPI cards and visuals to clearly highlight business performance


7️⃣ Data Validation & Finalization

Validated Power BI metrics against SQL Server source data

Ensured accuracy and consistency of KPIs before finalizing the report
